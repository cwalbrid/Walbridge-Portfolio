				<h1>A Bit About Me</h1>
				<p>
					I'd describe myself as curious, integrative, and collaborative. I like to know how things work, I like to connect the dots between ideas/concepts, and I love to work with other people.
				</p>
				<p>
					During my undergrad at the University of Michigan, I was a bit of a dabbler:
					<ol id="bragging">
						<li>
							<a href="http://www.wxyz.com/news/university-of-michigan-students-create-impressive-detroit-ad" target="_blank">I wrote and narrated an ad</a> for an Ann Arbor/Detroit transit program
						</li>
						<li>
							<a href="https://igr.umich.edu/" target="_blank">I facilitated dialogues</a> on race, gender, and sexuality
						</li>
						<li>
							<a href="http://lsa.umich.edu/soc/undergraduates/project-community.html" target="_blank">I taught creative writing</a> to male prison inmates
						</li>
					</ol>
					In my spare time, I helped put on TEDx events, went for runs in the Nichols Arboretum, and even played a bit of IQA Quidditch!
				</p>
				<p>
					I originally considered attending a tech bootcamp in Chicago called Startup Institute. Going through the application process for that program was my first exposure to the tech scene, and I was struck by how kind, knowledgable, and passionate the folks in tech are. Logistics for attending that program didn't work out, but it whet my appetite for pivoting to a career in tech.
				</p> 
				<p>
					I didn't have to look far to find to find a program of comparable quality in my own backyard. After reading lots of alumni testimonials and attending Grand Circus workshop + demo day events, I'm confident that Grand Circus is a solid choice.
